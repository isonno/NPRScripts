NPRScripts
==========

I like to listen to NPR podcasts in my car.  About once a week, I plug in a thumb drive to my PC and run this
script, which gathers up shows I like and downloads them to the thumb drive.

Right now the name of the thumb drive is hard coded (`G:` on Windows, `AUDIO` on the Mac) but someday I'll
search the mounted volumes for it.

Currently it grabs the weekly shows Car Talk, Wait Wait and This American Life, as well as the last four weekday
shows of Marketplace.  Marketplace was the first show I wrote the script for, hence the name "GetMktplace".
